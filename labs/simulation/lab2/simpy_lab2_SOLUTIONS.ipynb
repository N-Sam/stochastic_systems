    "**HINTS - Modelling the triage process:**\n",
    "* The first thing to code is a triage.  The patient needs to request a resource, wait for it to be available and then sample a triage duration from the correct distribution.  \n",
    "* Remember that to request a resource you need to follow this simpy pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">> with self.triage_bays.request() as req:\n",
    ">>     yield req\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Remember that simpy works by using **python generators**. Use the **yield** keyword in combination `simpy.Environment.timeout()` method to create delays in the process. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">> triage_delay = self.triage_dist.sample()\n",
    ">> yield self.env.timeout(triage_delay)\n",

    "**HINTS - Modelling assessment 1 and diagnostics processes**:\n",
    "* The tricky part of this modelling exercise is to model a percentage of diagnostics tests that occur in parallel to nurse assessment.  Some advice:\n",
    "  * For this exercise, you should assume that assessment 1 time begins the moment a patient is assigned a cubicle.\n",
    "  * Remember only 45% of patients need diagnostics and the nurse orders 75% of diagnostics tests to run in parallel to assessment 1.\n",
    "  * **Keep it simple** and build the model up incrementally.  I.e. build a simple model that runs and then add more detail to it.  \n",
    "  * A first task could be to model the proess where assessment is always followed by diagnostics.  You could then limit that to a percentage of patients. \n",
    "  * When diagnostics are in parallel you then you only need to model a delay that is the maximum of either assessment time or diagnostic waiting time + diagnostics duration.\n",
    "* A patient keeps their cubicle while undergoing diagnostics.  Don't allow the cubicle to be allocated to a new patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINTS - tracking time in the model**\n",
    "* You will need to keep track of how long it takes patients to complete processes in the model e.g. time to triage and time to first nurse assessment.\n",
    "* An example of recording a time in the model is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">> arrival_time = self.env.now\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you need to calculate a **time to something** you just need to take the difference between the current time and the arrival time. E.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">> self.time_to_triage = self.env.now - arrival_time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINTS - calculating end of run performance measures**:\n",
    "* In this exercise it is easiest to calculate your performance measures at the end of the model run.\n",
    "* `MinorInjuryUnit` holds a list of `MinorPatient` objects called `patients`.  Iterate (loop) over the list and access the relevant performance measure of each patient.  You can then take the mean.  For example, assume that you have an `MinorInjuryUnit`object assigned to the variable `model`.  To calculate the time to triage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    ">> mean_time_to_triage = 0.0\n",
    ">> for patient in model.patients:\n",
    ">>     mean_time_to_triage += patient.time_to_triage\n",
    ">> mean_time_to_triage = mean_time_to_triage / len(model.patients)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "alternatively you could use a list comprehension, cast to a `numpy.ndarray` and call the `mean()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">> mean_time_to_triage = np.array([patient.time_to_triage \n",
    "                                   for patient in model.patients]).mean()\n",
