## Simulation modelling for stochastic systems Lab 2

It is recommended that you complete `sim_lab2_autofit_intro.ipynb` before moving onto the input modelling exercises in `sim_lab2_preprocessing_im.ipynb`

## Introduction to automatic fitting

A short notebook that has an example of using an automatic fitting tool to select a input distribution for your model.

## Practical: preprocessing and input modelling on real world data

The main exercises this week are within `sim_lab2_preprocessing_im.ipynb`.  You will need to clean and preprocess data from a real world dataset before using input modelling techniques to select one or more distributions for the data.
