    "# Simulation models that include scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "Many health systems include a **scheduling** function.  This might for example be the scheduling of patient operations or appointments.  These systems are also queuing systems, but differ slightly from the systems we have already explored.  These models will need a **diary** to keep track of when patient events are scheduled and scheduling rules.  A scheduling rule might for example be limiting a specific type of operation to morning slots or to when a particular type of resource is available.  \n",

    "This work a simpy implementation of a model reported in a book chapter 'Systems Modelling for Improving Healthcare' by *Pitt, Monks and Allen* (2015) https://bit.ly/3j8OH6y \n",
    "\n",
    ">The model was originally built by Dr Michael Allen in a commercial simulation software called Simul8 - a very powerful simulaton package.  One of the long term problems of using a commerical package in health research is that for the NHS to use the model themselves they must pay for a license (the cost varies by vendor, but will be in the region of £5k-£20k with an annual maintence/support fee in the region of £1k).  This is particularly difficult for the NHS!   The model used here is an open python and simpy implementation of the same model.  One additional benefit is that model runtime is shorter in simpy as the diary function is sped up through numpy and we lose some of the feature bloat associated with commerical software.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Waiting times for mental health assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was used to investigate the waiting times for mental health appointments in Devon.  These were assessment type appointments.  Patients who are unwell are referred to the service by General Practitioners in primary care.  There is an initial triage of referrals before booking an appointment.  Some of these patients are signposted to more appropriate services while others are are classified as low priority or high priority (depending on severity of illness) and booked into an assessment clinic.  In an ideal world, high priority patients are seen within 5 working days while low priority patients are seen within 20 days. As we will see to do that is challenging!  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model simulates the clinics across Devon.  It includes 11 clinics - each of which has its own capacity that varies by day of week. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: the model simulates **indirect waiting time** for appointments.  That is the time between a referral and the the day of the appointment. It is not concerned with on the day waiting times (e.g. in a waiting room).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scheduling rules in the model \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule 1: Carve out\n",
    "* When queuing systems are struggling an option is to **carve out** or hold back some capacity for higher priority patients.  This means that high priority patients have access to all appointment slots while low priority patients have access to only a fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule 2: Home clinics\n",
    "* At the beginning of this project the situation was as follows: if a Exeter patient was unwell they were referred to the Exeter clinic. That is a patient must attend their home clinic (they could only attend 1 clinic). This was done even if there was a clinic nearby that had an earlier appointment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule 3: Partial pooling appointments across clinics\n",
    "* The objective of the modelling was to compare home clinic rule to a scenario where clinics worked together and pooled their appointments in a network.  For example, Exeter, Exmouth and Honiton might work together.  If a patient in Exeter was unwell they could then select the earlist appointment across these three clinics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the model\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the model you need to create an instance of `AssessmentReferralModel` and pass it an instance of `ScenarioArgs`.  The latter is a container class that holds all of the model parameters.  The code below runs the model.  We will learn how some of the modelling works in this lab, but feel free to explore the code in `sim_utility.scheduling_example`."

Where $T$ is measured in time units i.e. days and $C$ is the clinics.
